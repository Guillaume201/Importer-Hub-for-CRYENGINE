Installation
--
Before installing the program, be sure to use a 64 bits version of Windows with the .NET Framework 4.5 and the Visual C++ Redistributable 2012 installed.
Once downloaded, extract all files in one place.

Also, be sure to have set your CRYENGINE build path in the Settings Manager. You can find more informations on the official documentation here: http://docs.cryengine.com/display/SD...ttings+Manager

Note that the Magick.NET-x64.dll file is only required for the conversion of PSD and TGA textures. This means that you can run the program without this dll if you don't need the support of those extensions.

Assets import
--
With this tool you can import your files with a simple drag and drop on the application or by selecting them in your folders.
You can also import your textures from the clipboard, simple as a copy and paste!

Technically, this tool converts the textures in an understandable format for the Resource Compiler and opens the CryTif interface without Photoshop or any additional software.
For meshes, the files are directly sent to the Resource Compiler so they share the same limitations. That works great for static meshes in fbx.

The Resource Compiler used is the one defined by the Crytek's Settings Manager tool.

By default, the files are stored in the same directory than the input file. However, you can set a custom output folder affecting all the imported files!
For the textures provided by the clipboard, a dialog box lets you choose the filename and the output folder.

Custom links
--
Not exactly related to the asset pipeline, this tool allow you to define up to six links available directly in the interface.

For each link, you can define its title, its target path and some command line arguments.
This links can be used to open or execute every files, folders and web pages!
Also, you can use the [SDK_FOLDER] variable for retrieve the SDK path defined by the Crytek's Settings Manager.

Supported files
--
Textures: jpg, tga, psd, png, bmp, tif

Meshes: fbx, dae
